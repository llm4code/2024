> *Submission Link:* [https://llm4code2024.hotcrp.com/](https://llm4code2024.hotcrp.com/)

This workshop accepts both research papers and position papers:

- **Research papers (4 -- 8 pages including references)** on novel approaches, tools, datasets, or studies.
- **Position papers (1 -- 4 pages including references)** on novel ideas and positions that have yet to be fully developed.

All papers will be submitted via HotCRP and be reviewed in double-blinded. The submission should comply with the ACM format (in line with [ICSE 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2024/icse-2024-research-track#submission-process)) and should present the original contribution. At least one author of each accepted paper should register for the workshop and present the paper in the workshop.

**üèÜ We will announce the best paper and the best presentation awards during the workshop!**
