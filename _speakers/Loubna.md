title: Open development of Large Language Models for code with BigCode and StarCoder2
abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, Large Language Models (LLMs) for code have emerged as groundbreaking tools for code completion, synthesis, and analysis. BigCode is an open scientific collaboration for the responsible development of code LLMs. In this talk, we will cover some of the foundational elements of BigCode, including open large-scale code datasets such as The Stack, data governance, and transparency standards, as well as our approach for training the competitive StarCoder and StarCoder2 models.
